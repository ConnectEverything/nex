⚠️ The UI is not currently hooked up to any real Nex functionality, so please do not yet use this functionality ⚠️


# Nex UI
The Nex user interface is a local web server that can be accessed for a more user friendly
interface to functionality contained in the Nex CLI. This server defaults to running on 
port `8080`, so make sure you don't have any port conflicts before trying to launch it.

To start the Nex user interface, you can simply run `nex ui`
