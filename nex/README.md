# NEX CLI
The command line interface for the NATS execution engine provides a handy developer tool that can be used to interrogate
an execution environment, interact with individual nodes, and make requests to start and stop workloads. 

While there is a CLI binary (`nex)`), this package can be used as a library from other Go applications if desired.
